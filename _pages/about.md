I am a PhD research fellow in instrumentation and control. I'm very passionate about machine learning and deep learning especially the feeling when I finally succeed to understand complex algorithms and explain them clearly.

I enjoy working in a technical role, but, if necessary, I take on responsibility and lead a team when Iâ€™m the best person to do so. I care a lot about self improvement and learning new things, and I take every occasion I can to learn something new, whether through courses online on Coursera, or by pursuing side projects such as doing some fun experiments and blogging about machine learning.
